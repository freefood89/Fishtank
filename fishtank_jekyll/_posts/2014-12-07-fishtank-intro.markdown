Hello, 

Welcome to fish tank, a remote controlled and monitored fishtank. I created this project to enable me to feed and monitor my fish remotely during vacation or work trips. I eventually hope to create a tool that can control essential aspects of the fish's environment such as light, temperature, food, and water quality while learning to use new software and hardware such as [flask][flask-doc] and [raspberry pi][raspi]. Fishtank's software is available on [github][github-fishtank] as well.

Stay tuned for updates and thanks for visiting!
